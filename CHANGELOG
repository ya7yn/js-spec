[0.2.3]

- Fixed rake's task to include matchers in the source when building a package

[0.2.2]

- Fixed (1).should(be(1)) to check if both are numbers, then return x == y, else x === y
  and patched Object.isNumber to check for instanceof if typeof doesn't work
- ...I should've started keeping this long ago :-)
